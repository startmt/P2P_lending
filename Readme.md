## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Node version >= 10.16.0
- NPM version >= 6.9.0
## Development
### Client
In this mode, the app will auto-reload as soon as js source code changes.

Start the server by running
```
npm run dev
```
By default, the app will listen on port `3000`, but you can change it by passing `PORT` environment variable.
For example:
```
PORT=8080 npm run dev
```
You can also pass on [these valid environment variables](#environment-variables).

## Testing
### Client
Running a unit test
```
npm test
```
